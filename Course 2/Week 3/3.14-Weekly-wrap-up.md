# Weekly wrap-up

Well done on making it to the end of the week.

Certification lies at the very core of the way that we verify the identity of the networks that we are communicating with over the internet.

At the beginning of the week, we learnt that cryptographic keys aren't much help if they're not handled with care. If we're tricked into communicating with the ''man'' in the middle', it doesn't matter if they can't break our code because we'll have inadvertently handed them the keys.

Certificate authorities make sure we can verify who our communications partner really is by offering digital certificates that protect and carry public keys.  You can verify the authenticity and integrity of a certificate by checking the digital certification.  We've also looked at mechanisms for revoking digital certificates if they are somehow compromised.

Next week, we're going to take a look at how authentification and maintaining privacy in more detail, by looking at the SSL/TLS protocol.
