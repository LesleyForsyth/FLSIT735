Configuration is relatively simple from the server
side of the communication equation. First, the web
server administrator must acquire a digital certificate.
This can be obtained from a Certification
Authority (CA) such as VeriSign or RSA Data Security.
CAs require that certificates be renewed after
a set length of time, as a mechanism for ensuring
the identity of the owner of the applicationâ€™s server.
