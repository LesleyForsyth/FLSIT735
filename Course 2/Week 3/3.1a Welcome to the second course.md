Hello and welcome back to the second course.

Last week, you were introduced to the 'man in the middle' attacker.  This attack relies on an actor's ability to imitate a trusted system to send and receive information from people and networks that he would not otherwise not have access to.

Over the next two weeks, we're going to take a look at ways in which we can ensure that we are communicating with the people or systems that we think we are, and that they can be trusted.

In the first week, we'll take a look at the role of trusted third parties, or certificate authorities, to distribute cryptographic keys and how you can verify the certificates they provide by checking their digital signatures.  You'll also investigate replay attacks - where real data is intercepted and delayed or retransmitted in an attempt to fraudulently gain a network's trust.

In the following week, we'll look at securing wireless networks.

This course is essential to your second assessment task, which asks you to investigate the Comodo certificate hack and put in place security measures to prevent it affecting your organisation.  See [the program page - INSERT LINK HERE](#) for more detail.

### Your task

How do you think you will be able to put what you'll learn this week into practice in your workplace?
