In this week... (Chris, please, could you write one of these nice summaries of yours?)


Many books have been written on SSL/TLS, hence what you have seen during this week is just an introduction. For example, we haven't introduced the Diffie-Hellman key exchange in SSL/TLS, which is considered more secure, albeit less efficient, than the one introduced in previous steps. Therefore, for a short reading on SSL/TLS we recommend you to visit the link bellow. For a comprehensive explanation of SSL/TLS you can read "SSL and TLS: Theory and Practice".
