Congratulations on getting to the end of another week.

Throughout the week, you've explored how commonly used network protocols verify a user's identity and share digital cryptographic keys confidentially.  You've learnt the role of nonces - a kind of code that is used only once - in ensuring that an eavesdropper couldn't fool you by imitating a previous message that's been sent.

In the process, you applied protocol verification tools to evaluate the security of your own communications network.

Once you understood the principles of digital verification and key distribution, you were in a position to explore SSL/TLS.  This protocol was developed to protect commercial and other sensitive transactions online and remains the most important and relevant security protocol to digital communications networks today.  Many books have been written on SSL/TLS, so what you have seen during this week is just an introduction.

### Further reading

For example, we haven't introduced the Diffie-Hellman key exchange in SSL/TLS, which is considered more secure, albeit less efficient, than the one introduced in previous steps. Therefore, for a comprehensive explanation of SSL/TLS you can read "SSL and TLS: Theory and Practice". For a more fun and entertaining talk on what can go wrong with HTTPS look at the talk by Moxie Marlinspike at the famous conference Blackhat:

Finally, from a practical point of view, you can follow [these instructions](https://blog.codeship.com/how-to-set-up-mutual-tls-authentication/).

### Your task

What did you find most interesting or surprising this week?  How will you use your new learning in the workplace?
