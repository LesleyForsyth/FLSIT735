Few years back we were used to surf the web over the HTTP protocol (Hypertext Transfer Protocol). This protocol has not build-in security, hence our traffic is wide open for attackers to read and modify. Back in 1994, Netscape Communications created HTTPS (Secure HTTP) for its Netscape Navigator web browser. Since then HTTPS has become the protocol of choice for clients and servers on the internet. Google for example, ranks better HTTPS websites than HTTP websites, making it more attractive for websites to switch to HTTPS despite of the obvious efficiency lost. As computer security experts, we most be happy that by 2018, HTTPS is used more often than the non-secure HTTP. 

You can easily recognise if your browser is using HTTPS by locking at the url and the small *lock* there in. The picture next depicts how HTTPS looks like in different browsers.

## Your task 

Share with yours fellow learners those websites that you are currently using that are still over HTTP. For security reasons I'm going to ask you NOT to click on any of them.
