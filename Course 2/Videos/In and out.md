## Introduction

Hello and welcome back to the second course in Communications Network Security.

In this course, we'll explore network security protocols.

Computer networks weren't initially designed with hackers in mind, so we are left we an ever evolving task to ensure that the information we communicate remains protected.  

In the first week, we'll look at the security protocols that have been developed at the application and network layer.

In the second week, we'll look at wireless communications protocols and how you can employ them to keep your networks safe from people with mean to do you, or your clients, harm.

Good luck and I hope to see you in the comments section.


## Wrap up

Congratulations.  

You're at the end of the second course on Communications Network Security.

Over the past two weeks, we've taken a look at the standards and protocols that have been developed to defend communications networks against attack, and learnt how they can be applied to secure your network.

Wirelesss technologies present a new set of challenges for communications network security and we are seeing improvements in security protocols all the time.  We hope that, by now, you are able to ensure that your wireless networks are not any more vulnerable to attacks than they need to be.

Next week, we'll take a look at the secure distribution of keys, which lies at the very heart of defeating man in the middle attacks.

Well done and I hope to see you again soon.
