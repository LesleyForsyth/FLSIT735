## Introduction

Hello and welcome back to the second course in Communications Network Security.

In this course, we're going to investigate digital certification, SSL and key distribution.

You might have heard the corny old joke that on the internet, nobody knows that you're a dog.  

In a communication's network like the internet, we need to have some kind of system in place to verify that people are who they tell us they are.  Given that every message sent over the internet needs a set of keys to unlock, we need to be sure what we're unlocking comes from the person we think it does.  

This week we'll look at digital certification.  Certificate authorities are charged with issuing digital certificates which verify that a message truly does come from the network it claims to.  

Next week we'll follow up by taking a look at the network architecture we call SSL and its role in ensuring that your connection remains private and secure.  Finally, we'll take a look at how how cryptograhic keys are distributed safely and securely throughout communications networks. 

These two weeks are going to be critical for your second assessment tasks.  Good luck, and I hope to speak to you more in the comments section.


## Wrap up

Congratulations.  

You're at the end of the second course on Communications Network Security.

Over the past two weeks, we've taken a look at digital certification, SSL and the distribution of crypto keys.  These measures are all central to ensuring that our communications remain secure and confidential.  However, as you can probably guess, they're not perfect and we need to ensure that our systems are properly set up and maintained to keep intruders out.

Well done, and I'll see you again next week.
