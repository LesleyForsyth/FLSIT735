## Introduction

Hello and welcome back to the second course in Communications Network Security.

In this course, we're going to investigate digital certification, SSL and key distribution.

You might have heard the corny old joke that on the internet, nobody knows that you're a dog.  

In a communication's network like the internet, we need to have some kind of system in place to verify that people are who they tell us they are.  Given that every message sent over the internet needs a set of keys to unlock, we need to be sure what we're unlocking comes from the person we think it does.  

This week we'll look at digital certification.  Certificate authorities are charged with issuing digital certificates which verify that a message truly does come from the network it claims to.  

Next week we'll follow up by taking a look at the network architecture we call SSL and its role in ensuring that your connection remains private and secure.  Finally, we'll take a look at how how cryptograhic keys are distributed safely and securely throughout communications networks. 

These two weeks are going to be critical for your second assessment tasks.  Good luck, and I hope to speak to you more in the comments section.


## Wrap up

Congratulations.  

You're at the end of the second course on Communications Network Security.

Over the past two weeks, we've taken a look at digital certification, SSL and the distribution of crypto keys. 

Secure cryptographic keys cannot be created or distributed without the agreement of others.  We must work together to follow processes and protocols that protect our networks, while leaving them to function as efficiently as possible. If you're responsible for the security of your organisation's communications networks, you will need to make sure that you know how these protocols function.  

This will help you to make sure your networks are compliant and that you are sharing information confidentially with someone who's identity you have verified.  It will be most important when something has gone wrong. Where you suspect that the has been an attack on your network, or a breach, knowing how these protocols function can help you figure out what's gone wrong and plan your next move. 

Well done, and I'll see you again next week.
