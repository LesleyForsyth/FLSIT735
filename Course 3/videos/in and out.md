## Introduction

Hello, welcome back to Communications Network Security.

This course is all about keys.  You will recall that messages can only be encrypted and decrypted using keys.  No-one without a key should be able to send or receive the message.

But how do you make the right people, and only the right people, have access to these keys?  How can you verify you're talking to the right people and not someone impersonating them?  

The answer is certificates.  In the first week, we'll look at certificate protocols and learn how to use them to communicate with other networks securely.  In the second, we'll look at exchanging keys and how this process is authenticated.

This course is essential for your second assessment task, so pay close attention.

Good luck.


## Wrap up

Hi again.

You're now more than halfway through Communications Network Security.

Over the past fortnight you learnt how keys are distributed and authenticated.  When you are setting up or maintaining the security of your communications network, it's essential that you can apply this knowledge.  This will make sure, as much as it is possible to be sure, that your organisation and the people that it serves are talking to who they think they are and not someone who wants to cause them trouble.

I'll see you again soon.
