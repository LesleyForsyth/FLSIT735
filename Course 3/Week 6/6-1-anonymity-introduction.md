# Anonymity and privacy: an introduction

During the first four weeks of this course you have received a fairly comprehensive introduction to the principles of building secure communication protocols. The goal of a secure communication protocol is to ensure authenticity, confidentiality, and integrity. Whenever we engage in a communication, those are the three basic properties we should be aiming for. But, is security all we need when we communicate?

You are probably thoroughly aware of the Facebookâ€“Cambridge Analytica data scandal, which involves the gathering and sharing of personally identifiable information of up to 87 million Facebook users. All that, without the user's awareness or consent. This is not new, Facebook admitted that it has been sharing private data with approximately 60 phone manufacturers, such as Apple and Samsung.


Software development companies have indeed shifted to a data-centric model, where users do not longer pay with money, but with their personal data. Google does that, Facebook does that, and all major Software companies do that in one way or another. 

Collecting and selling users' data to third parties is a common practice today, but one that may not last long. That is why you, as a citizen unwillingly to give up on you privacy rights or as an employee of a company offering privacy-friendly software products, should embrace current and future technologies for private and anonymous communication. This is the goal of this week.

## Do we really need privacy?

If you ask to someone whether privacy is important, often you receive an answer like - I don't mind identifying myself as I have nothing to hide. That's very likely the answer of an honest, yet naive, person. You can find immediately the flaw on this view on privacy by asking next - All right, then here it is my email address, send me all your private emails, you have nothing to hide - You will wait forever. 

Privacy is not a luxury, is a right and often a need. 

There is still a lot of debate and disagreement on what privacy means, and to what extends users should have full control over its private information. Perhaps, a similar debate ocurred in United States back in the 1980s, when U.S. laws forbid the export and non-military use of secure cryptography. That's no longer a debate, and everyone understand how important is that we all, militaries or not, enemies or foi, use strong and good cryptography. The privacy debate may get into a similar end in the near future. 

One of the founders of Tor, a technology we are going to be looking at soon, say - *Humanity got a lot problems that can only be solved through better and more dedicated communication, freer expression, and more freedom of thought*. The latter can be only enforced if private or anonymous communication is possible. Anonymity actually plays a prominent role in established democratic societies. For example, paying cash, voting, opinion polling, and displaying creativity are everyday examples of anonymous activity. If this is still not a good argument, I propose you to read the book *1984* by George Orwell.
