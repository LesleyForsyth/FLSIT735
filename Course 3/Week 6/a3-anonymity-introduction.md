# Anonymity and privacy: an introduction

During the first four weeks of this course you have received a fairly comprehensive introduction to the principles of building secure communication protocols. The goal of a secure communication protocol is to ensure authenticity, confidentiality, and integrity. Whenever we engage in a communication, those are the three basic properties we should be aiming for. But, is security all we need when we communicate?

Imagine that I, the professor, would like to collect statistics about the number of students that haven't done a single task of those at the end of each step. Thus I ask my students. But I suspect that some students may be reluctant to reveal such information, as this is may be embarrassing. Instead, I would ask something like:

* Say yes if your date of birth ends in an odd number or if you haven't done a single task in this unit.

Assuming that I have no means to figure out your date of birth (actually I do), then I cannot tell whether a "yes" means that your date of birth ends in an odd number or if you haven't done a single task in this unit. Nevertheless, despite the uncertainty, I do have a mean to roughly estimate the number of students that didn't do their duties. Let's assume that you are 100 students and I obtain 51 yes to my query. Statistically 50 students have a date of birth that is an odd number. Therefore, I can clearly conclude that at least 1 student didn't do the homework at all, but I cannot tell which one. Isn't that remarkable? Well, you have been just introduced to the notion of *anonymity* and *privacy*.

You are probably thoroughly aware of the Facebookâ€“Cambridge Analytica data scandal, which involves the gathering and sharing of personally identifiable information of up to 87 million Facebook users. All that, without the user's awareness or consent. This is not new, Facebook admitted that it has been sharing private data with approximately 60 phone manufacturers, such as Apple and Samsung.


Software development companies have indeed shifted to a data-centric model, where users do not longer pay with money, but with their personal data. Google does that, Facebook does that, and all major Software companies do that in one way or another. 

Collecting and selling users' data to third parties is a common practice today, but one that may not last long. That is why you, as a citizen unwillingly to give up on you privacy rights or as an employee of a company offering privacy-friendly software products, should embrace current and future technologies for private and anonymous communication. This is the goal of this week.
