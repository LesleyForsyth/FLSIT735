# Do we need privacy?

If you ask to someone whether privacy is important, often you receive an answer like - I don't mind identifying myself as I have nothing to hide. That's very likely the answer of an honest, yet naive, person. You can find immediately the flaw on this view on privacy by asking next - All right, then here it is my email address, send me all your private emails, you have nothing to hide - You will wait forever. 

Privacy is not a luxury, is a right and often a need. 

There is still a lot of debate and disagreement on what privacy means, and to what extends users should have full control over its private information. Perhaps, a similar debate ocurred in United States back in the 1980s, when U.S. laws forbid the export and non-military use of secure cryptography. That's no longer a debate, and everyone understand how important is that we all, militaries or not, enemies or foi, use strong and good cryptography. The privacy debate may get into a similar end in the near future. 

One of the founders of Tor, a technology we are going to be looking at soon, say - *Humanity got a lot problems that can only be solved through better and more dedicated communication, freer expression, and more freedom of thought*. The latter can be only enforced if private or anonymous communication is possible. Anonymity actually plays a prominent role in established democratic societies. For example, paying cash, voting, opinion polling, and displaying creativity are everyday examples of anonymous activity. If this is still not a good argument, I propose you to read the book *1984* by George Orwell.
