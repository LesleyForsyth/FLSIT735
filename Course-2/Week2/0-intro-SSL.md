# SSL

Electronic commerce, banking, business, are all commonplace today and have one feature in common: processes that before where executed via physical interaction are now executed remotely through a computer network, at any time and from every where. To do so, electronic services ought to mimic the same role that was performed before by, for example, bank employees. A bank employee would first verify the identity of the client, and right after  act as an intermediary between the client and the bank computer system. 

In electronic services the network is the intermediary. And we should admit that a computer network is faster than a human processing and transmitting information. Thus businesses become more cost-effective and efficient. But, who is going to check the identity of the clients? You probably already know the answer: a security protocol. 


SSL/TLS is the most widely used and more important technology to secure electronic services, such as electronic commerce, electronic business, and electronic government. This is particularly true on the internet, where most of the traffic is secured with SSL/TLS protocols. Therefore, we find important to teach about the fundamental principles behind this family of security protocols. 

Simply invoking SSL/TLS won't make your application more secure, in the same way that cryptography itself does not make communication stronger. It is necessary to understand the underlying components and features of the protocol, functional requirements, and security requirements as well.
