# SSL


SSL/TLS is the most widely used and more important technology to secure electronic services, such as electronic commerce, electronic business, and electronic government. This is particularly true on the internet, where most of the traffic is secured with SSL/TLS protocols. Therefore, we find important to teach about the fundamental principles behind this family of security protocols. 

Simply invoking SSL/TLS won't make your application more secure, in the same way that cryptography itself does not make communication stronger. It is necessary to understand the underlying components and features of the protocol, functional requirements, and security requirements as well.
