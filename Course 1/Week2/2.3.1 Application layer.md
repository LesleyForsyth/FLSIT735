## Now that you have an overview of the TCP/IP protocol suite, we're going to take a closer look at communications protocols located at each layer. Lets start with an Application layer. 




### HTTP (HyperText Transfer Protocol)
HTTP is that the set of rules for transferring files (text, graphic pictures, sound, video and different transmission files) between an internet server and a client browser over the Internet. Whenever you try to access any website on the Internet, this is the protocol comes to help you. HTTP is used to transfer Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) web contents.

### HTTPS (HyperText Transfer Protocol Secure)
HTTPS is the secure version of HTTP. It encrypts and decrypts the request from client to server and response from server to client. So that Man-in-the-Middle can not exploit the information. HTTPS uses SSL (Secure Socket Layer) that manages message transmission security across the Internet.
