ARP stands for Address Resolution Protocols, which is responsible for mapping an Internet Protocol address to a physical address of the machine.

* IP address - 32 bits - Logical address of the computer
* MAC address - 48 bits - Physical (MAC) address of the computer

ARP cache is a table which maintains a correlation between each MAC address and its related IP address.

## Why we need ARP
To detect the conflict in the IP address on the same network, we need Address Resolution Protocol. Each host in the network score ARP cache to detect the IP address conflict.
When a new node joins the network, It announces "Hey everyone, IP address 10.11.12.13 has hardware address DD:EE:FF:DD:EE:FF." If any other host in the network has the same IP address, the conflict will be detected.

## How ARP spoofing actually works
ARP spoofing occurs when a host sends false ARP message that intentionally misleads everyone in the network. Let's take an example to understand it.

|  | IP Address | Hardware Address |
| -------------| ------------|--------------|
| Attacker | 10.3 | YY:YY 
| Victim Host | 10.5 | AA:AA
| Network Router (gateway) | 10.1 | BB:BB
| Remote Machine | 20.20 | CC:CC

### Steps of ARP spoofing
1. Attacker tells the victim, "Hey, AA:AA, the MAC address of 10.0.0.1 is YY:YY".
2. Attacker tells the router, "Hey, BB:BB, the MAC address of 10.0.0.5 is YY:YY".
3. The victim needs to send some traffic to the remote machine:
    * In victim's cache, it already knows the MAC address of the router. It creates a frame for YY:YY with the destination IP of 20.20.
    * The frame arrives at the attacker's NIC. It is copied or altered, and the attacker then creates a new frame with destination MAC address BB:BB and IP address 20.20.
4. The router forwards the packet along and eventually 20.20 replies back. The router must now deliver the reply packet to the victim.
    * It router's cache, it already knows the MAC address of the victim. It creates a frame for YY:YY with a destination IP of 10.5.
    * The frame arrives at the attacker's NIC. It is copied or altered, and the attacker then creates a new frame: destination MAC address AA:AA and IP address 10.5.

This is also called ARP poisoning or ARP MiTM (Man in The Middle). Steps 1 and 2 need to be repeated frequently to keep the ARP table updated with the misleading information. This will result in the unusual no. of ARP requests in the network and eventually make it easy to detect ARP spoofing.

### MAC duplicating/spoofing
An attacker can configure their own NIC's MAC address as sam MAC address to another NIC in the network. It is possible to have a two NIC with the same MAC address as the layers above data link layer don't care about the multiple NIC's having same MAC address. In this case, the attacker will be able to receive/hear all the frames destined to the configured duplicate MAC address.

Overall, ARP spoofing may allow an attacker to intercept
data frames on a network, modify the traffic, or
stop all traffic by causing a target to associate an IP
address with an incorrect MAC address.
