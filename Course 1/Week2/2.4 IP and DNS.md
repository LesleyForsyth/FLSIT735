## Seated in the network layer, the internet protocol (IP) is the single most common protocol nowadays

The Internet Protocol(IP) is simply the internet's addressing system. Every single machine on the Internet is identified by Internet Protocol(IP) address that takes the form of a series of digits separated by dots or colons. Each computer on the Internet has at least one IP address that uniquely identifies it from all other computers on the internet. The IP protocol standardizes the way machines forward or routes their packets based on their IP addresses. The routing process for each machine is same whether they are computers or printers or smartphones etc.

The original version of IP (known as IPv4) forms addresses consisted of four pairs of digits such as 62.45.65.85 or 244.156.123.45. The rapid growth of internet generated high demand for unique IP addresses. In January 2011, all possible combinations of IP addresses were used up which motivated the introduction of new IP system called IPv6 with a more possible combination of unique IP addresses.  

### IP address
IPv4 is a 32-bit and IPv6 is a 128-bit number for each host on a network. For routing efficiency, the IP address is divided into two parts: the prefix is used for identification of a network and thus known as a network address and the suffix is used as identification of a host machine for a particular network thus known as a host address. A unique prefix is required for each network on the internet. There are total five classes of IP address known as Class A, B, C, D and E.

### Netmasks
Netmasks represents which part of the IP address is a network ID and which part is Host ID. For class A, netmask is always 255.0.0.0. For class B, netmask is 255.255.0.0.

### IP Routing
Each IP packet travels one router to another until they reach to its destination. IP protocol software is installed on each and every hosts and router which use a routing table to evaluate where to send a packet next. Entries on routing table can be updated either manually by a network administrator or automatically by Routing Information Protocol(RIP). When IP receives a packet from higher-level protocols such as TCP or UDP, it find closest possible routing path towards the destination IP address from its routing table entries. The most specific to the least specific route in the routing table is in the following order:
* A route that matches the destination IP address directly (Host route).
* A route that matches the network ID of the destination IP address (Network route).
* The default route.

### DNS
When we talk about website addressing, we normally refer them using human-speakable format like www.websitenameexample.com rather than using their actual IP addresses. After all the website data is stored at one of the host machine on the internet and accessing website means contacting particular host machine on the internet where the website data is stored. Because of the DNS(Domain Name System), we are able to translate the website name into the IP address and that is the reason we are able to access any website data to our web browser.

### DHCP
In the network, DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol) is responsible for assigning the IP addresses to each computer upon the request.


### Your task
Practice how IP addressing and subnetting works. How we can form networks on the internet using the characteristics of IP addresses. Investigate why do we use dynamic IP addressing more compared to static IP addressing?
