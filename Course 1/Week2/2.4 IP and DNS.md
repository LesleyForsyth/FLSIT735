## Now that you have an overview of computer network architectures, we're going to take a closer look at communications protocols on the network layer.  The internet protocol (IP) is the single most common of all.

The Internet Protocol(IP) is essentially the web's addressing framework. It gives an IP address to every machine on the internet which can be used to distinguish it from every other machine.  

Each and every machine on the Internet is recognized by Internet Protocol(IP) address that appears as a progression of digits isolated by spots or colons. Every PC on the Internet has no less than one IP address that extraordinarily distinguishes it from every other PC on the web. The IP protocol standardizes the way machines forward or routes their packets based on their IP addresses. The routing procedure for each machine is same whether they are PCs or printers or cell phones and so forth.

The original version of IP (known as IPv4) forms addresses consisted of four pairs of digits such as 62.45.65.85 or 244.156.123.45. The rapid growth of internet generated high demand for unique IP addresses. In January 2011, all possible combinations of IP addresses were used up which motivated the introduction of new IP system called IPv6 with a more possible combination of unique IP addresses.  

### IP address
IPv4 is a 32-bit and IPv6 is a 128-bit number for each host on a network. For routing efficiency, the IP address is divided into two parts: the prefix is used for identification of a network and thus known as a network address and the suffix is used as identification of a host machine for a particular network thus known as a host address. A unique prefix is required for each network on the internet. There are total five classes of IP address known as Class A, B, C, D and E. On a windows machine, You can open IPv4 properties by going to the properties of the network adapter.

If you want to see the current IP configuration using command prompt, then open command prompt by pressing 'windows key + R', type 'cmd' and press enter. Once command prompt is open, type 'ipconfig' then press enter.

### Netmasks
Netmasks represents which part of the IP address is a network ID and which part is Host ID. For class A, netmask is always 255.0.0.0. For class B, netmask is 255.255.0.0.

### IP Routing
Each IP packet travels from one router to another until they reach its destination. IP protocol software is installed on each and every hosts and router which use a routing table to evaluate where to send a packet next. Entries on routing table can be updated either manually by a network administrator or automatically by Routing Information Protocol(RIP). When IP receives a packet from higher-level protocols such as TCP or UDP, it finds closest possible routing path towards the destination IP address from its routing table entries. The most specific to the least specific route in the routing table is in the following order:
* A route that matches the destination IP address directly (Host route).
* A route that matches the network ID of the destination IP address (Network route).
* The default route.

### DNS
When we talk about website addressing, we normally refer them using a human-speakable format like www.websitenameexample.com rather than using their actual IP addresses. After all the website data is stored at one of the host machines on the internet and accessing website means contacting particular host machine on the internet where the website data is stored. Because of the DNS(Domain Name System), we are able to translate the website name into the IP address and that is the reason we are able to access any website data to our web browser.

### DHCP
In the network, DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol) is responsible for assigning the IP addresses to each computer upon the request.

### Your task
Practice how IP addressing and subnetting works. refer link https://support.microsoft.com/en-au/help/164015/understanding-tcp-ip-addressing-and-subnetting-basics.  
How can we form networks on the internet using the characteristics of the IP addresses? Investigate why do we use dynamic IP addressing more compared to static IP addressing?
