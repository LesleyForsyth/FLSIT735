# Network Architecture: A key component of Cyber Security

### Review notes: I'm sure this is important content, but I don't have a sense of how the layers work together.  I also don't have any sense of an answer to the first questions we asked.

Do we all need to follow the same rules on the internet?

What would happen if we all followed our own rules when communicating online?  

To answer these questions, let's first start by looking at standard network archietcture.  This conceptual models uses a set of communications protocols to communicate with others online and on similar computer networks.

A network is divided into different functional components called layers. We will discuss the two main layer models: OSI and TCP.

## OSI network model
The Open Systems Interconnection model (OSI model) is a theoretical model that embodies and regulates the communication functions of a computing system without respect to its underlying interior structure and technology. Its goal is to ensure the interoperability of various communication systems with standard protocols. There are several layers in the OSI network model. Each layer serves the layer above it and is served by the layer below it.

Let's take a look at it in a little bit more detail:

* **Layer 1 - Physical Layer**: It represents connectors, wiring and specifications on how voltage and bits pass over cable or on wireless mediums.

* **Layer 2 - Data Link Layer**: This layer is responsible for linking data between nodes.  It is responsible for error control and flow control services.

* **Layer 3 - Network Layer**: The network layer is the one that defines how interconnected networks function. It takes a data from the transport layer and wraps it inside a packet or datagram.  We're going to be looking at the netowork layer in detail during the course.

* **Layer 4 - Transport Layer**: It is responsible for reliable message transfer and communication between programs or processes. Port or socket numbers are used to identify these unique processes. TCP is an example of Transport Layer protocol. Examples of transport layer protocols are TCP, UDP, SCTP, DCCP etc.

* **Layer 5 - Session Layer**: It controls the connections/sessions between computers. Examples of session layer protocols are NetBIOS and RPC (Remote Procedure Call).

* **Layer 6 - Presentation Layer**: The presentation layer transforms data into the form that the application accepts. It also does encryption and compression. Examples of presentation layer protocols are MIME, SSL, TLS, XDR etc.

* **Layer 7 - Application Layer**: The application layer is the OSI layer closest to the end user, which means both the OSI application layer and the user interact directly with the software application. Example of Application layer protocols are FTP, SNMP, SMTP and Telnet.

### Layers in application - VIKRANT AND ROLAND TO ADD CONTENT

Let's give a very simple example to give you an overview of how these layers might work together to deliver a message.

Paul wants to send an email to his professor... (description of what each layer is doing to pass the message from one person to another).

## TCP/IP protocol suite

It is commonly known as TCP/IP because the foundational protocols in the suite are the Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) and the Internet Protocol (IP). It consists of four main layers such as Data Link Layer, Network Layer, Transport Layer and Application Layer.

## TCP/IP layers and associated devices

* **Layer 3** - **Network Layer** - **Router, Layer 3 switch**
* **Layer 2** - **Data Link Layer** - **Bridge, Switch**
* **Layer 1** - **Physical Layer** - **Hub, Repeaters**

### Your task
After exploring OSI network model and TCP/IP protocol suite, do you think layered abstraction helps to increase the security in our networks?  How can the protocols be improved?
