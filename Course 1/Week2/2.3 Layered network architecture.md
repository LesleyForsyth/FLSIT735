# Network Architecture: A key component of Cyber Security

The network architecture is a conceptual model that uses set of communication protocols for communication over the internet and similar computer networks. What happens if everyone follows their own rules to communicate over the internet?

## A network is divided into different functional components called layers. We will discuss the two main layer models OSI and TCP.

## OSI network model
The Open Systems Interconnection model (OSI model) is a conceptual model that characterizes and standardizes the communication functions of a telecommunication or computing system without regard to its underlying internal structure and technology. Its goal is the interoperability of diverse communication systems with standard protocols. There are several abstraction layers in the OSI network model. Each layer serves layer above it and is served by the layer below it.

* **Layer 1 - Physical Layer**: It represents connectors, wiring and specifications on how voltage and bit pass over the cabled or wireless medium.

* **Layer 2 - Data Link Layer**: It is responsible for error control, flow control services and delivering frames between NICs on the same physical segment. Communication at data link layer is based on MAC addresses (Physical address). It takes data from network layer and wraps inside a frame. Example of data link layer protocols are Ethernet, Token Ring, Point-to-Point Protocol(PPP), SBTV, SLIP etc.

* **Layer 3 - Network Layer**: Network layer is the one that defines how interconnected networks function. It is responsible for assigning a Logical Address to each computer and Routing packet from source computer to destination computer. It takes a data from the transport layer and wraps it inside a packet or datagram. Examples of network layer protocols are IP, IPsec, ICMP, IGMP, OSPF, RIP etc.

* **Layer 4 - Transport Layer**: It is responsible for reliable message transfer and communication between programs or processes. Port or socket numbers are used to identify these unique processes. TCP is an example of Transport Layer protocol. Examples of transport layer protocols are TCP, UDP, SCTP, DCCP etc.

* **Layer 5 - Session Layer**: It controls the connections/sessions between computers. Examples of session layer protocols are NetBIOS and RPC (Remote Procedure Call).

* **Layer 6 - Presentation Layer**: The presentation layer transforms data into the form that the application accepts. It also does encryption and compression. Examples of presentation layer protocols are MIME, SSL, TLS, XDR etc.

* **Layer 7 - Application Layer**: The application layer is the OSI layer closest to the end user, which means both the OSI application layer and the user interact directly with the software application. Example of Application layer protocols are FTP, SNMP, SMTP and Telnet.


## TCP/IP protocol suite

It is commonly known as TCP/IP because the foundational protocols in the suite are the Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) and the Internet Protocol (IP). It consists of mainly four layers such as Data Link Layer, Network Layer, Transport Layer and Application Layer.

## TCP/IP layers and associated devices

* **Layer 3** - **Network Layer** - **Router, Layer 3 switch**
* **Layer 2** - **Data Link Layer** - **Bridge, Switch**
* **Layer 1** - **Physical Layer** - **Hub, Repeaters**

## Effect of the Network Architecture on Cyber Security

The network architecture is a conceptual model that uses set of communication protocols for communication over the internet and similar computer networks. What happens if everyone follows their own rules to communicate over the internet?

## Your task
After exploring OSI network model and TCP/IP protocol suite, Layered abstraction helps to increase the security in our networks? If yes then how? If no then, what can we do to optimise the security of the overall network? Do we need a new network protocol suite which outperforms the existing TCP/IP protocol suite? or TCP/IP is the ultimate solution for the future?
