# Network Architecture : A key component of Cyber Security

Network architecture is a coceptual model that uses set of communication protocols for communication over the internet and simillar computer networks. What happens if everyone follows their own rules to communicate over the internet?

## A network is divided into different functional components called layers. We will discuss the two main layer models OSI and TCP.

## OSI network model
The Open Systems Interconnection model (OSI model) is a conceptual model that characterizes and standardizes the communication functions of a telecommunication or computing system without regard to its underlying internal structure and technology. Its goal is the interoperability of diverse communication systems with standard protocols. There are sevel abstraction layers in the OSI network model. Each layer serves layer above it and is served by the layer below it.

* **Layer 1 Pysical Layer**: It represents a relationship between a device and a physical transmission medium such as electrical cable, an optical fibre cable or radio frequancy link etc.

* **Layer 2 Data Link Layer**: It is responsible for error control and flow control services. Example of data link layer protocols are Point-to-Point Protocol(PPP), SBTV, SLIP etc.

* **Layer 3 Network Layer**: Network layer is the one that defines how inter connected networks function. It is responsible for Logical Addressing and Routing. Examples of network layer protocols are IP, IPsec, ICMP, IGMP, OSPF, RIP etc. 

* **Layer 4 Transport Layer**: It is responsible for reliable message transfer over the Internet. It also take care of flow control of packets and known as a connection-oriented protocols. TCP is an example of Transport Layer protocol. Examples of transport layer protocols are TCP, UDP, SCTP, DCCP etc.

* **Layer 5 Session Layer**: It controls the connections between computers. Examples of session layer protocols are TCP, RTP , PPTP etc.

* **Layer 6 Presentation Layer**: The presentation layer transforms data into the form that the application accepts. Examples of presentation layer protocols are MIME, SSL, TLS, XDR etc.

* **Layer 7 Application Layer**: The application layer is the OSI layer closest to the end user, which means both the OSI application layer and the user interact directly with the software application.



## TCP/IP protocol suite

It is commonly known as TCP/IP because the foundational protocols in the suite are the Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) and the Internet Protocol (IP). It consists of mainly four layers such as Data Link Layer, Network Layer, Transport Layer and Application Layer.

## TCP/IP layers and associated devices
* **Layer 3** - **Network Layer** - **Router**
* **Layer 2** - **Data Link Layer** - **Bridge, Switch**
* **Layer 1** - **Physical Layer** - **Hub**



## Effect of the Network Architecture on Cyber Security

Network architecture is a coceptual model that uses set of communication protocols for communication over the internet and simillar computer networks. What happens if everyone follows their own rules to communicate over the internet?


## Think questions
After exploring OSI network model and TCP/IP protocol suit, Layered abstraction helps to increase the security in our networks? If yes then how? If no then, what can we do to optimise the security of the overall network. Do we need a new network protocol suit which outperforms the existing TCP/IP protocol suit? or TCP/IP is the ultimate solution for the future?
