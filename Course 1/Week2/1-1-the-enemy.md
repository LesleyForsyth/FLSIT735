# Network Architecture : A key component of Cyber Security

Before we deep dive into cyber security and its communication protocols, it is important to understand how the network is formed and how communication takes place into the network. Knowledge about the Network Architecture is crutial to understand how it can be used to break the privacy of our data. In this chapter, we willl find out several interesting facts about Network Architecture. Lets start with the first question.

* **What is the role of Network Architecture in the Cyber Security:** The answer of this question lies in the history of Network Architecture.

* **What is a Network Architecture**

* **How Network Architecture works**

* **Network Architecture and its impact on Cyber Security**


## History of the Network Architecture

* **1950s**: Development of electronic computers begin. 

* **1960s**: Development of ARPANET (Advanced Research Projects Agency Network) project funded by United States Department of Defense. In 1969, first message was sent over the ARPANET from University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) to Stanford Research Institute(SRI). 

* **1970s**: Era of various Packet switching networks such as NPL network, ARPANET, Tymnet, Merit Network, CYCLADES and Telenet. In 1967, Donald Davis demonstrated the first packet switching at the National Physical Laboratory(NPL), UK. ARPANET project led to the need of the development of the protocols for internetworking which resulted into the development of Internet protocol suite known as TCP/IP.

* **1980s**: In 1986, NSF funded several universities to develop national supercomputing centers and provided interconnectivity with NSFNET(National Science Foundation Networks) project. Commercial ISPs(Internet Service Providers) started participating in the late 1980s. In addition, Tim Berners-Lee invented World Wide Web(WWW) which links hyper text document to the Information systems such a way that it can be accessible from anywhere in the world.

* **1990s**: Invention of electronic mail, instant messaging, VoIP telephone calls, Video calls and World Wide Web has resulted into unbelievable growth of the internet after mid 1990s. In addition, Fiber optic technology has supported the rapid growth of two way data transfer rate over the internet.

## Think questions

Its been almost 70 years now, since the journey of Internet(Packet switching to TCP/IP protocol suite) started in 1950s. It is worth to think what would be the scenario after 70 years from now. Are we ready for the future? What kind of challenges we may face next? How can we contribute to the development of the new world? What could be the extension of the Internet?  

## Our concern in this unit

This unit focuses on various cyber security attacks which affects communication protocols running in a computer network faces. Although it may seem little at first glance, we will see throughout this unit that man-in-the-middle attacks have driven the development of the majority of network protocols we use nowadays. We encourage the student to continue their formation in Cyber security by mastering other aspect of Cyber security that are not covered here.
