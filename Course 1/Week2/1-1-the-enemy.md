# Knowing the Enemy

Every person can potentially hack or compromise your data. Before computers, the more sophisticated hacking machine is due to Prof. Alan Turing, who broke the Enigma machine. With the emergence of computer 
networks, a computer addicted with no permanent girlfriend became the most common profile of a hacker. Today, almost anyone can infect thousands of computers thanks to a long list of simple-to-use hacking tools that are publicly available.

## Threat actors

When looking at the security landscape of any organisation, or even at your private network at home, it is useful to know who wants to harm you, why for, and how. Typically, security experts categorise attackers depending on the attacker's motivation, resources, and knowledge about an organisation. The most important of those categories are the following. 

* **Government Sponsored**: This is formed by highly skilled security professionals with the time and resources necessary to perform sophisticated and targeted attacks. Government sponsored attacks will be typically driven by political, economic or military interests. 

* **Organised Crime**: This type of attacker will look for credentials than can be used to steal credit or hijack critical digital resources that can be exchanged for a ransom. 

* **Hacktivists**: Hacktivists aim for attacks with large impact in media and are normally driven by a political agenda. 

* **Insider Threat**: Disgruntled employees or ex-employees that look for financial gain or revenge. What makes this threat actor particularly dangerous is its knowledge and access to the physical and digital facilities of an organisation. 

* **Opportunistic**: Attackers driven by the desire for notoriety. 


## Attack mechanisms

Another way to look at cyber security threats within an organisation is by charaterising the most basic type of attacks. 

* **Eavesdropping**: Eavesdropping is the most basic and primitive capability an attacker uses. In network communication, this consists in intercepting data from network traffic. 
* **Cryptanalysis**:  The art of breaking cryptography. All security protocols rely on cryptography. If cryptography fails, the whole system fails as well. 
* **Password pilfering**: The most widely user aunthentication mechanism in use is based on a user identifier and a password. However, humans have proven notoriously bad at choosing and managing passwords. Thus is often easy for an attackers to guess or social engineer a password. 
* **Man-in-the-middle**: Similarly to eavesdropping, a man-in-the-middle attack can intercept network traffic. In addition, this attack blocks, modifies, and injects data in the network. 
* **Software exploitation**: Many security attacks nowadays start with a software vulnerability that has been found and exploited. 
* **Malicious software**: Known malware, this type of software is designed to harm computers and to be executed silently, without the user's awareness. 
* **Denial of service**: A denial of service attack aims at shutting down a particular service. 

It is worth remarking that attack types can be combined, in the same way that different threat actors may collaborate.

## Our concern in this unit

This unit focuses on counteracting man-in-the-middle attacks, which is the most powerful attack a communication protocol running in a computer network faces. Although it may seem little at first glance, we will see throughout this unit that man-in-the-middle attacks have driven the development of the majority of network protocols we use nowadays. We encourage the student to continue their formation in Cyber security by mastering other aspect of Cyber security that are not covered here.
