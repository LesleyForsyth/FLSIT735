# Port scanning

Once attacker knows the IP address of the live hosts, next step is to find out what applications hosts are running. By knowing running applications and its vulnerabilities, it is easier for an attacker to take further decisions. On server, Applications are associated to port numbers. For example, HTTP uses port number 80. If port number 80 is open, that means computer could be the web server. There are port number range between 0 to 1023 and each number indicates certain application. Attacker sends a port scanning probes to each identified host in order to determine which applications are running on that host. In the background, port identification process sends an connection to a program on a particular port number. If program responds with the agreement, then it means that particular port is open on the host.

Public IP addresses are controlled by worldwide registrars. however port numbers are not controlled by anyone. Port numbers are 16 bits unsigned integer and unique for each compouter.

* Well known ports (0 - 1023)
* Registered ports (1024 - 49151)
* Dynamic/private ports (49512 - 65535)

### Example of well known port numbers:
* echo – 7 - TCP
* ftp-data – 20 - UDP
* ftp – 21 - TCP
* ssh – 22 - TCP
* telnet – 23 - TCP
* domain – 53 - UDP
* www-http – 80 - TCP



### Your task
Investigate association of port scanning with TCP/IP protocol stack. Which layer in TCP/IP protocol stack is connected to ports?
