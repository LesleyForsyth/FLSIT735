# Spoofing

The next type of systems attack you should keep watch for is spoofing.

Most of you have probably gotten a scam phone call, where someone pretends to be someone they are not.  If, for example, we're unfortunate enough to fall victim to scammers pretending to represent a bank, we might give them sensitive information such as our passwords, bank or credit card detials.

Scammers protect themselves by making sure their caller number is false or untracable and they work because they only thing we have to verify they are who they are is their voice.  

In exactly the same way, scammers can try to 'call' us from  an IP address.  Any IP address in a network is, therefore, untrustworthy unless we have some way of authenticating it.

Caller ID spoofing allows an attacker to modify or change displayed number on the screen. Mainly this is possible on VoIP networks which allows attacker to present false name and numbers. 

A spoofing attack occurs when an attacker impersonates another device or user on a network in order to launch attacks against network hosts, steal data or spread malware to bypass access controls.

## Reason behind Spoofing

Spoofing can only be successful because of flaws in protocol's and application's verification functions.  Many TCP/IP protocols do not check sender and receiver messages, and many applications don't follow any verification processes whatsoever.  This allows just about anyone to connect to the application.

Spoofing doesn't only come from IP addresses.  The ARP and DNS can also be spoofed.

### How to mitigate Spoofing

There are two good ways to mitigate against a spoofing attack.  

One way is to inspect the data packet at your firewall.  Because spoofing relies on impersonating something from inside the the trusted network, we can filter out packets which have conflicting source addresses - that is, packets from outside the network that show IP addresses from inside the network, and vice-versa.

We also need to ensure we have systems in place to verify that messages are coming from who or what we think they are.

Next, we will go through each spoofing attacks in details.
