Hi Chris, Could you please paraphrase this page? 
Thank you.

We all (likely) have been subject to phone call
scams. Such scams are based on two components.
First, lack of mean to identify the caller's phone number.
Second, we use voice identification, ergo weak
authentication. We will see that the source identifier
(an IP address) in a network is also untrustworthy unless authentication is used.

Caller ID spoofing allows an attacker to modify or change displayed number on the screen. Mainly this is possible on VoIP networks which allows attacker to present false name and numbers. Main reason behind caller ID spoofing is the different laws in different countries which does not affect the attacker.

A spoofing attack occurs when an attacker impersonates another device or user on a network in order to launch attacks against network hosts, steal data, spread malware to bypass access controls.

## Reason behind Spoofing

* No authentication mechanism in TCP/IP protocols: Many TCP/IP protocols do not check sender and receiver message's authenticity which is the main reason spoofing is possible.

* Application lack verification functionality: Applications do not follow any verification process for either sending or recieving hosts which allows anyone to connect to the application.

## Types of spoofing attacks:
* IP address spoofing
* ARP spoofing
* DNS spoofing

### How to mitigate Spoofing

* Verification of sender and receiver's identity.
* Deep packet inspection at the firewall.



Next, we will go through each spoofing attacks in details.

### Your task
Investigate the difference between Sniffing and Spoofing.
