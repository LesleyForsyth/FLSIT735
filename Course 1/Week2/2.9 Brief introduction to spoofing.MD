# Spoofing

We all (likely) have been subject to phone call
scams. Such scams are based on two components.
First, lack of mean to identify the caller's phone number.
Second, we use voice identification, ergo weak
authentication. We will see that the source identifier
(an IP address) in a network is also untrustworthy unless authentication is used.

A spoofing attack occurs when an attacker impersonates another device or user on a network in order to launch attacks against network hosts, steal data, spread malware to bypass access controls.

### Types of spoofing attacks:
* IP address spoofing
* ARP spoofing
* DNS spoofing

### Your task
Investigate the difference between Sniffing and Spoofing.
