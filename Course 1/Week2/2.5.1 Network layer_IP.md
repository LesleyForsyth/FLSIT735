## Now that you have learned about transport layer and TCP, we're going to take a closer look at communications protocols on the network layer. The Internet protocol (IP).

When Bob sends a message to Professor Steve, we learned what happens at application layer and transport layer. Lets see how Bob's network layer acts upon receiving a message from Bob's transport layer.

The network layer determines where data should be sent to and retrieved from. It is essentially the Internet's addressing framework. It gives an unique IP address to every machine on the internet which can be used to distinguish it from every other machine. The routing process is the same whether the machine is a PC, printer, phone or anything else.

Examples of network layer protocols are:
* Internet Protocol (IP): is a connection less protocol. It  does addressing of hosts and routing of data from source to destination across one or more types of networks.
* Address Resolution Protocol (ARP): used to find out machines MAC address from known IP address.
* Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP): used to report error messages to the host machine when there is anything wrong in the network connection such as destination not reachable, time exceeded etc.

Let's look at the characteristics of IP protocol:
* Unique addresses: Like postal address is unique to our house, IP addresses provides unique addresses to each and every computer over the Internet so that they can be uniquely identified for the message delivery purpose.
* Connectionless communication: Unlike TCP, IP does not require to establish the connection before it starts sending the data over the Internet.
* Routing: IP is aware when a computer's IP address is not part of the local group of computers or somewhere else. Routing is the intelligent process of delivering a message based on the IP information of a computer and routers(specialized routing devices).
* Unicast, Broadcast and Multicast: 


Let's take an example to understand this:


## IPv4
IPv4 is the popular and widely used version of IP protocol.

Lets look at the 


### IP address

The original version of IP (known as IPv4) forms addresses which consist of four pairs of digits such as 62.45.65.85 or 244.156.123.45. The rapid growth of internet generated high demand for unique IP addresses. In January 2011, all possible combinations of IP addresses were used up.  A new IP system was introduced called IPv6 with a greater number of possible combinations of unique IP addresses.  

IPv4 is a 32-bit and IPv6 is a 128-bit number for each host on a network. For routing efficiency, the IP address is divided into two parts:

* the prefix, which is used for identification of a network and thus known as a network address 
* the suffix, which is used as identification of a host machine for a particular network thus known as a host address. 

Of course, for this to work a unique prefix is required for each network on the internet.

If you want to see the current IP configuration using command prompt, then open command prompt by pressing 'windows key + R', type 'cmd' and press enter. Once command prompt is open, type 'ipconfig' then press enter.

### Netmasks
Netmasks represents which part of the IP address is a network ID and which part is Host ID.  They vary by [IP class](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classful_network). For class A, netmask is always 255.0.0.0. For class B, netmask is 255.255.0.0.

### IP Routing

IP packets travel from one router to another until they reach its destination using a routing table to figure out where to send it next. When IP receives a packet from higher-level protocols such as TCP or UDP, it finds the closest possible routing path towards the destination IP address from its routing table entries. The most specific to least specific route in the routing table is listed in order below:

* A route that matches the destination IP address directly (Host route).
* A route that matches the network ID of the destination IP address (Network route).
* The default route.

### DNS
When we talk about website addressing, we normally refer them using terms that most people would find simple to understand, like www.websitenameexample.com, rather than using their actual IP addresses. However, all the website's data is stored at one of the host machines on the internet. Accessing the website means contacting the particular host machine. Because of the DNS (Domain Name System), we are able to translate the website name into the IP address and that is the reason we are able to access website data using our browsers.  The DNS is often compared to an address book, which maps domain names to IP addresses.

### DHCP  
In the network, DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol) is responsible for assigning the IP addresses to each computer.

### Putting it all together - Vikrant or Rolando to write

Explain how each of the elements described in this step work together to form a network.  'Paul wants to visit the Professor's website.'

### Your task 

Have you spotted any weaknesses in the internet protocol?  How do you think its vulnerabilities might be exposed by hackers?
