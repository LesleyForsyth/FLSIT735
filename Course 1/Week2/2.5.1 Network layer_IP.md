## Now that you have learned about transport layer and TCP, we're going to take a closer look at communications protocols on the network layer. The Internet protocol (IP).

When Bob sends a message to Professor Steve, we learned what happens at application layer and transport layer. Lets see how Bob's network layer acts upon receiving a message from Bob's transport layer.

The network layer determines where data should be sent to and retrieved from. It is essentially the Internet's addressing framework. It gives an unique IP address to every machine on the internet which can be used to distinguish it from every other machine. The routing process is the same whether the machine is a PC, printer, phone or anything else.

Examples of network layer protocols are:
* Internet Protocol (IP): is a connection less protocol. It  does addressing of hosts and routing of data from source to destination across one or more types of networks.
* Address Resolution Protocol (ARP): used to find out machines MAC address from known IP address.
* Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP): used to report error messages to the host machine when there is anything wrong in the network connection such as destination not reachable, time exceeded etc.

Let's look at the characteristics of an IP protocol:
* Unique addresses: Like postal address is unique to our house, IP addresses provides unique addresses to each and every computer over the Internet so that they can be uniquely identified for the message delivery purpose.
* Connectionless communication: Unlike TCP, IP does not require to establish the connection before it starts sending the data over the Internet.
* Routing: IP is aware when a computer's IP address is not part of the local group of computers or somewhere else. Routing is the intelligent process of delivering a message based on the IP information of a computer and routers(specialized routing devices). 

Let's look at IPv4 and see how IP assign unique addresses to each computer on the Internet.

## IPv4

Internet Protocol based network is a group of hosts that share a common physical connection and that use IP for the network layer communication. IPv4 is the popular and widely used version of IP protocol. IPv4 is a 32-bit address and its format is XXX:XXX:XXX:XXX. 

### How many possible unique IP addresses possible?
As IP address is a 32-bit address, total no. of possible unique IP addresses = 2^32 = 429,49,67,296 (nearly 4.3 Billion). It look like a fair amount of IP addresses. But,
In January 2011, all possible combinations of IP addresses were used up, that means we have exceeded more than 4.3 billion hosts. Here you will think, how IP maintain its duty to assign unique IP address to each computer on the Internet then? Well, let's look at how IP uses few different type of IP addresses to fix the problem.

Range of IP addresses looks like: 
000.000.000.000 to 255.255.255.255

## Address type in an IP network:


* Host address: A host's IP address is the address of a specific host on an IP network. All hosts on a network must have a unique IP address. This IP address is usually not the first or the last IP address in the range of network IP addresses as the first IP address and last IP address in the range of IP addresses are reserved for special functions. The host addresses are all the addresses in the IP network range of IP addresses except the first and last IP addresses.
* Network address: The network address is the first IP address in the range of IP addresses. To be more precise, the network address is the address in which all binary bits in the host portion of the IP address are set to zero. 

* Broadcast address: The broadcast IP address is the last IP address in the range of IP addresses. To be more precise, the broadcast address is the IP address in which all binary bits in the host portion of the IP address are set to one. The broadcast address is reserved and allows a single host to make an announcement to all hosts on the network. This is called broadcast communication and the last address in a network is used for broadcasting to all hosts because it is the address where the host portion is all ones.

HOW IT WORKS

Your computer uses a a mask in its network connection that allows it to determine whether the computer it wants to talk to over the local network is actaully on the local network or on a network outside the local network. If it is a computer that is local, it will use a local protocol to find the other computer's hardware address. If the other computer is not local (it is outside the local network), then it will send the data to the local gateway (usually called the default gateway). Your computer will try to determine the hardware address of the local default gateway and will use the hardware address in the Ethernet header (or FDDI header or Token Ring header etc.). The Ethernet frame will contain a payload which will be filled with IP data. The IP address of the remote computer will be in this payload as part of the IP header. Since the IP address in the IP datagram is the remote computer, but the Ethernet frame is addressed to the local default gateway, the default gateway will accept the Ethernet frame, read the IP data, verify the IP address is indeed outside the local network and then forward the IP datagram over whatever other network connections the computer has that will allow it to reach all the other outside networks.

That's how Internet Protocol makes routing work in a network with a default gateway.

### Routers - What they do?
Routers are NOT used for local communication on the local IP network. They are bypassed completely and are not required. Routers are used to forward data into different networks and to restrict broadcasts on the local network from swamping external networks with traffic that is important only to the local network.

### IP address

The original version of IP (known as IPv4) forms addresses which consist of four pairs of digits such as 62.45.65.85 or 244.156.123.45. The rapid growth of internet generated high demand for unique IP addresses. In January 2011, all possible combinations of IP addresses were used up.  A new IP system was introduced called IPv6 with a greater number of possible combinations of unique IP addresses.  

IPv4 is a 32-bit and IPv6 is a 128-bit number for each host on a network. For routing efficiency, the IP address is divided into two parts:

* the prefix, which is used for identification of a network and thus known as a network address 
* the suffix, which is used as identification of a host machine for a particular network thus known as a host address. 

Of course, for this to work a unique prefix is required for each network on the internet.

If you want to see the current IP configuration using command prompt, then open command prompt by pressing 'windows key + R', type 'cmd' and press enter. Once command prompt is open, type 'ipconfig' then press enter.

### Netmasks
Netmasks represents which part of the IP address is a network ID and which part is Host ID.  They vary by [IP class](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classful_network). For class A, netmask is always 255.0.0.0. For class B, netmask is 255.255.0.0.

### IP Routing

IP packets travel from one router to another until they reach its destination using a routing table to figure out where to send it next. When IP receives a packet from higher-level protocols such as TCP or UDP, it finds the closest possible routing path towards the destination IP address from its routing table entries. The most specific to least specific route in the routing table is listed in order below:

* A route that matches the destination IP address directly (Host route).
* A route that matches the network ID of the destination IP address (Network route).
* The default route.

### DNS
When we talk about website addressing, we normally refer them using terms that most people would find simple to understand, like www.websitenameexample.com, rather than using their actual IP addresses. However, all the website's data is stored at one of the host machines on the internet. Accessing the website means contacting the particular host machine. Because of the DNS (Domain Name System), we are able to translate the website name into the IP address and that is the reason we are able to access website data using our browsers.  The DNS is often compared to an address book, which maps domain names to IP addresses.

### DHCP  
In the network, DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol) is responsible for assigning the IP addresses to each computer.
