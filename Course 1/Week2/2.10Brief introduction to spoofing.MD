We all (likely) have been subject to phone call
scams. Such scams are based on two components.
First, lack of mean to identify the caller phone number.
Second, we use voice identification, ergo weak
authentication. We will see that the source identifier
(an IP address) in a network is also untrustworthy,
unless authentication is used.
