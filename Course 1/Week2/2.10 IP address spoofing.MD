# IP spoofing

In the last step, we learnt that spoofing occurs when our system is tricked into trusting an impersonation.

IP spoofing is when the attacker uses a false IP address to send data packets into our networks.  Just like a phone scammer with a fake number, the false IP addresses can either hide the attacher's identity or impersonate another computer system.  To set up this up, you need to modify the source IP address, a checksum and the order value in the packet header.

The Internet is a packet switched network.  That means every packet which leaves from one computer will travel through various computers and reach the destination in a different order. The receiving machine resembles the message based on the order value as per the packet header information. The process generates a sequence number - allowing the receiving machine to reassemble the information - and an acknowledgement number from the 3 way handshake that occurs in the TCP.

## Variations of IP spoofing:

There are a number of different ways that an attacker can launch an IP spoofing attack.  Let's take a look at someof them.

* Non-blind spoofing: In this type of attack, the attacker is on the same [subnet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subnetwork) as their victim. The sequence and acknowledgement numbers can be sniffed and their session can then be hijacked. THe session is then re-established based on the attacker's sequence and acknowledgement numbers.  Congratulations: a hacker is now connected to your network, and your network thinks they are someone else.

* Blind spoofing: In this type of attack, the attacker is on a different subnet as a victim so the sequence and acknowledgement number are unreachable. In order to attack, several packets are sent to the target machine in order to take a of their sequence numbers. Operating systems use a random sequence number which decreases the probability of falling victim to an attack.  

* Man In the Middle Attack: In this attack, the attacker intercepts a legitimate communication between two friendly parties. The attacker then controls the communication and no-one is the wiser.

* Denial of Service Attack: In this attack, the attacker wants to flood the packets to the victim by modifying the source IP address information. Attackers target is to consume victim's bandwidth and resources. When multiple compromised hosts are participating in the attack, it is very hard to stop.

## How to stop IP spoofing:

* Filtering the packets at the router: Implementing ACL (Access Control List) which blocks internal IP address on the downstream interface.

* Encryption and Authentication: In Ipv6, encryption and authentication are included which reduces the risk of spoofing.

### Your task
Investigate IP spoofing mitigation techniques. What is Ingress filtering? How can we configure it on the edge routers?
