# Welcome to Week 2

## Last week, we learnt that online communications are only secure when we speak in code words.

The code should not be understood without a key - or set of keys - to decrypt and translate the message.  In some ways, this is a little bit like two people who speak different languages having a conversation via an interpreter.  If you’re having a confidential conversation, you’d want to be able to trust your interpreter to translate what you have said accurately and not to pass on details of your conversation to anyone else.

Imagine what could happen if you trust the wrong person. It may be very difficult to tell. This kind of behaviour, in which someone (or something) untrustworthy imitates a translator to a speaker and/or a speaker to a translator, is sometimes called a ‘man in the middle attack’.

Quoting Sun Tzu in The Art of War: If you know the enemy and know yourself, you need not fear the result of a hundred battles. If you know yourself but not the enemy, or every victory gained you will also suffer a defeat. If you know neither the enemy nor yourself, you will succumb in every battle. During this week we will get to know the network, our battlefield. We will also learn the capabilities of the most threatening enemy to network protocols, the man-in-the-middle adversary.

During this week, we are going to see, 
* How the internet is formed as a result of billions of interconnected devices.
* How a message travels over the internet from source to destination.
* How a Man-in-the-Middle can exploit the communication over the internet.

Shall we get started?

Good luck.

-----------------------
In particular, we’re going to look at sniffing, snooping and Man-in-the-Middle(MitM) attack.

However, if you want to secure your communications networks, it's important to understand how it works. So before we can investigate how a 'man in the middle attack' works, we'll need to take a look at protocols in the network layer, in particular.

Before we deep dive into Man-in-the-Middle, and associated, attacks, it is important to understand how the network is formed and how communication takes place inside the network. Knowing about Network Architecture is crucial to understand how it can be used to break into confidential data.

To understand the role of network architecture in cybersecurity, you first need to know a little bit about the history of computer networks.

### Your task

Have you ever come across or read about a Man-in-the-Middle(MitM) attack? What did you understand and what were the consequences?

You will want to [install the Kali version of Linux on VirtualBox]( https://ma.ttias.be/running-kali-linux-as-a-vagrant-box-virtual-machine/) to take part in this week's activities.
