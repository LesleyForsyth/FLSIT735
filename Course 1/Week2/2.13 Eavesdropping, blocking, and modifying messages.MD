# Man-in-the-Middle attack(MitM)

A man-in-the-middle attack is a common type of cyber security attack which can do following:
* Allows an attacker to eavesdrop the communication between two targets.
* Allows an attacker to block the communication between two targets.
* Allows an attacker to modify the communication between two targets.

## Two types of MitM

* Passive MitM: Only listening to the communication and not modifying it.

* Active MitM: Listening and modifying the communication.

## How to mitigate MitM attacks

* Strong encryption on access points
* Use of Virtual private network
* Force HTTPS
* Strong authentication scheme

## Summary of Week 2
We started this week with the history of networking. We then discussed the OSI layers and TCP/IP protocol suite. Then we discussed Network layer, Transport layer and its associated protocols. We discussed the Man-in-the-Middle attack in detail including how sniffing, port scanning and spoofing works. We discussed powerful packet sniffer Wireshark and port scanner Nmap. In the end, we discussed how attacker spoof the communication using IP address, ARP requests and DNS requests.

Overall, we have learned how network architecture is core part of the networking protocols and digital communication.

Hope you have enjoyed the week 2. See you again in week 3.

### Your task

Find out the recent known MitM attack. Investigate how actually attacker executed it? What could have helped to mitigate it? Prepare a report on it.
