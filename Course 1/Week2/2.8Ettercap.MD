# Ettercap

This is a sophisticated network security tool that can launch Man-in-the-Middle attacks.

## Usage
* Network analysis
* Security auditing
* Sniff network traffic
* Capture passwords

## Four models:
* **IP-based :** Filtered packets by IP address.
* **MAC-based :** Filtered packets by MAC address.
* **ARP-based :** Sniff packets between two hosts on a switched network.
* **Public ARP-based :** Sniff packets froma user to all hosts.

## Wireshark - Protocol analyzer
Wireshark (Previously known as Ethereal) is one of the best known tool for packet analysis. It allows us to right click on a TCP packet and choose "Follow TCP stream" to rebuild an entire Layer 7 protocol session.
