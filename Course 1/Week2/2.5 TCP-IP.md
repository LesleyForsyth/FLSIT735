## TCP is the most widely used transport layer protocol

As you already know, the IP is used to determine _where_ data is sent and retrieved from.  The transmission control protocol (TCP) determines _how_ this happens.

The other part of the control system, Transmission Control Protocol (TCP), sorts out how packets of data move back and forth between one computer (in other words, one IP address) and another. It's the TCP that figures out how to get the data from the source to the destination, arranging for it to be broken into packets, transmitted, resent if they get lost, and reassembled into the correct order at the other end. The TCP takes charge of ensuring that communications over the internet are reliable.

The figure above shows how TCP views a communication system in form of layers when it connects two hosts between different networks.

### Characteristics of TCP

The TCP is designed to have some essential characteristics.  It is:

* Connection-oriented: every application uses the TCP to request a connection. Once established, it is used to transfer the requested data.

* Reliable: TCP gives a guarantee that the sent data will be delivered in the same format without any duplication or damage. <br/><br/> If the packet gets lost, TCP fixes it by retransmitting it.  To ensure that data is delivered reliably, the TCP sends an acknowledgement to the sender once the data is received.  If the sender doesn't receive it within a certain time period, the TCP retransmits the data.

* Reliable startup: The Sender and receiver agree to establish a connection before the data is transmitted.

* Full-duplex connection: Data flows in both directions.


### TCP connection process

__Each TCP connection has exactly 2 endpoints.

As you can see, the TCP creates two separate  connections for two different HTTP processes. The only difference between the connections is that they use a different port number.__ __IS THIS SECTION NECESSARY?  WHY IS IT IMPORTANT?__

You might be wondering how this connection process works.  

The connection occurs using a 3 way handshake between a client and a server. It works like this: 
* the client asks for a connection to a server using a synchronised packet (SYN)
* the server acknowledges the client's request (SYN-ACK)
* the client acknowledges that it has received the server's SYN-ACK and a communication channel is established.

### ICMP
Internet Control Message Protocol is a set of messages that communicate errors and other problems that require attention. One common application is a 'ping.'  Pings test how long it takes on average to make a round trip from a client to a host and back, and what percentage of the packet is lost.

### How data travels from source to destination on the Internet

The Internet is a combination of different networks connected to each other. The connection between different networks is formed by router and switches.

The figure above shows how data actually travels from source to destination via switches and routers.

### Your task
Execute commands from the ICMP protocol, such as ping and traceroutes.
