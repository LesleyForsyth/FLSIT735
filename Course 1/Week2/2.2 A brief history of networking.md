# What was the intention of connecting multiple computing devices? What they missed and included when they commenced the journey of forming the internet from a single computer.


* **1950s**: Development of electronic computers started. 

* **1960s**: Development of [ARPANET](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ARPANET) (Advanced Research Projects Agency Network) project started which was funded by United States Department of Defence.

Network was formed using [IMPs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interface_Message_Processor#BBN_Report_1822) (Interface Message Processor)(today's so called [router](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Router_(computing))   ) and TIPs(Terminal Interface Processor). TIPs enabled individual computer terminals to connect directly to the ARPANET.

Figure below displays how ancient router looked like.

Figure below represents how computers were connected in the ARPA network in 1973. You will be surprised to know that the distacne between UCLA and SRI was 643kms.

In 1969, the first message was sent over the ARPANET from the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) to Stanford Research Institute (SRI). 

        At the UCLA end, they typed in the 'l' and asked SRI if they received it; 'got the l' came the voice reply. UCLA typed in the 'o', asked if they got it, and received 'got the o'. UCLA then typed in the 'g' and the darned system CRASHED! Quite a beginning. On the second attempt, it worked fine!

* **1970s**: Era of various [packet switching networks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Packet_switching) such as NPL network, ARPANET, Tymnet, Merit Network, CYCLADES and Telenet. In 1967, Donald Davis demonstrated the first packet switching at the National Physical Laboratory (NPL), UK. ARPANET project led to the need of the development of the protocols for internetworking which resulted into the development of Internet protocol suite known as TCP/IP.

* **1980s**: In 1986, NSF funded several universities to develop national supercomputing centres and provided interconnectivity with NSFNET (National Science Foundation Networks) project. Commercial ISPs (Internet Service Providers) started participating in the late 1980s. In addition, Tim Berners-Lee invented World Wide Web (WWW) which links hypertext document to the Information systems in such a way that it can be accessible from anywhere in the world.

* **1990s**: Invention of electronic mail, instant messaging, VoIP telephone calls, video calls and the world wide web has resulted in the unbelievable growth of the internet we have witnessed from the mid-1990s. In addition, fiber optic technology has supported the rapid growth in the two-way data transfer rate over the internet.

It's been almost 70 years now since the journey of the Internet (Packet switching to TCP/IP protocol suite) started in the 1950s. It is worth to think what would be the scenario after 70 years from now. Are we ready for the future? What kind of challenges may we face next? How can we contribute to the development of the new world? What could be the extension of the Internet?  

## Our concern in this unit

This unit focuses on various cybersecurity attacks which affect communication protocols running on a computer network. Although this may seem like a narrow focus at first glance, we will see throughout this unit that man-in-the-middle attacks have driven the development of the majority of network protocols we use nowadays. That being said, we'd encourage you to learn about every type of cyber attack you are likely to face.

### Your task

When did you first have access to a computer network?  How have computer networks evolved since then?
