# DNS spoofing

DNS spoofing constitutes a major risk to the security of your network.


As you may remember, to send messages between people in different networks, you need to exchange IP addresses. Your connection request will have to include a return IP address or else the other server won't know where to return the requested data to.

You may also recall that IP addresses are associated with website addresses.  When we type in an address in the browser, it's the DNS that points us towards the associated IP address.  


So, how can you spoof it?

Unfortunately, an attacker can replace an website's IP address with another one. Afterwards, users who go to the victim's web address will be redirected to a website chosen by their attacker.

## DNS servers hierarchy

DNS servers are organized in a hierarchy.

If the original DNS server does not know the IP address for the requested website it will forward on the request.  Typically they are forwarded onto DNS root servers, which between them form registeries for the vast majority of online content.

There are 13 DNS root servers in total. These are connected in a hierarchy.If an attacker ever managed to bring them all down, they would paralyze the whole internet.

### Your task
Investigate the attempts to strengthen DNS security and its effectiveness. What is DNSSEC? Do you have any suggestion(s) to improve the way the DNS system works?
