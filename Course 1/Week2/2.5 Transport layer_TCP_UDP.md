## TCP is the most widely used Transport layer protocol. What is TCP's role over the Internet?

When Bob sends a message to Professor Steve, we learned what application layer does. Lets see how Bob's transport layer acts upon receiving a message from Bob's application layer.

Transmission Control Protocol (TCP), sorts out how packets of data move back and forth between one computer (in other words, one IP address) and another(IP address). It's the TCP that figures out how to get the data from the source to the destination, arranging for it to be broken into packets, transmitted, resent if they get lost, and reassembled into the correct order at the other end. The TCP takes charge of ensuring that communications over the internet are reliable.

The figure above shows how Bob's transport layer (TCP) views a communication system in form of layers when it connects to Steve's computer(Steve's transport layer) which is in different network. Bob's transport layer will just deal with lower layers. Lets see what TCP offers:


## What is the role of TCP?

Every device has unique IP address over the Internet. That means, IP address identifies a device/computer. But one computer/device can run multiple applications or services. How can we distinguish/identify them? For example, Bob is running Skype on his computer while Steve is running Google chrome and Skype on his computer. When Bob send a Skype message to Steve, message will travel over the Internet and reach to Steve's computer(based on Steve's IP address) without any trouble. But how Steve's computer will handle Bob's message? Steve's computer will think: Should i deliver Bob's message to either Skype or Google chrome?

Well the answer is at the transport layer. __Ports at Transport layer identifies the application/services running on every computer.__


### Characteristics of TCP

The TCP is designed to have some essential characteristics.  It is:

* Connection-oriented: every application uses the TCP to request a connection. Once established, it is used to transfer the requested data.

* Reliable: TCP gives a guarantee that the sent data will be delivered in the same format without any duplication or damage. <br/><br/> If the packet gets lost, TCP fixes it by retransmitting it.  To ensure that data is delivered reliably, the TCP sends an acknowledgement to the sender once the data is received.  If the sender doesn't receive it within a certain time period, the TCP retransmits the data.

* Reliable startup: The Sender and receiver agree to establish a connection before the data is transmitted.

* Full-duplex connection: Data flows in both directions.


Lets understand TCP by its characteristics:

## What do we mean by connection-oriented?
Connection-oriented means, before Bob and Steve be able to exchange any message using TCP, they need to establish a connection first. 

How that happens? Using 3-way handshake between Bob and Steve.

__Steps of 3-way handshake:__ 
The connection establishment occurs using a 3-way handshake between a Bob's transport layer and Steve's transport layer. It works as shown below: 
* Step 1: Bob's transport layer asks for a connection to Steve's transport layer using a synchronized packet(SYN)
* Step 2: Steve's transport layer acknowledges Bob's SYN request via SYN + ACK.
* Step 3: Bob's transport layer acknowledges(by sending ACK) that it has received SYN-ACK from Steve's transport layer and a communication channel is established.

Figure below represents 3-way handshake process between Bob and Steve.

So far, we have seen, What is the role of TCP, TCP's characteristics and How connection between two applications(__NOT__ computers) establish using TCP.


Once connection is established between Bob's application and Steve's application, Bob's application can start sending data to Steve's application.

## What if there are multiple applications running on Bob's computer and Steve's computer?

Easy, each application will need to establish their own TCP connection which is known as a TCP socket connection.

### What is TCP socket?

Socket = IP address + Port number

    Bob's IP address - 192.168.1.50
    Bob's skype application port number - 222
-------------------------------------
    Steve's IP address - 10.10.0.50  
    Steve's skype application port number - 444 


For examples, If Bob's skype application sends a TCP packet to Steve's skype application, TCP packet will include socket information as shown below:
   
    Source Port : 222
    Source IP address : 192.168.1.50

    Destination Port : 444
    Destination IP address : 10.10.0.50


Figure below represents how socket information is used in each TCP packet which travels from one computer to another.

Very important to remember that __Each TCP connection has exactly 2 endpoints.__

__As you can see in the figure above, the TCP creates two separate  connections for two different HTTP processes. The only difference between the connections is that they use a different port number.__

# Port numbers

It uses 16 bits to represent. So total possible combinations are 2^16 = 65536. It's value starts from 0 to 65535.

Port numbers are divided as:

1. Well-known(Fixed) port numbers (0-1023)
    These port numbers are used by well know server services over the Internet. For example, 
    
      HTTP uses port number 80 
      HTTPS uses port number 443 
      SMTP uses port number 25

These port numbers are fixed for well known services. Why? 

Lets assume that port numbers are not fixed for well known services such as HTTP. That means Bob doesn't know what port number HTTP is using. Having this scenario, if Bob wants to login to DeakinSync without knowing the port number of HTTP (Bob's web browser application will need HTTP protocol to connect to DeakinSync), he will not have success. Even, no one will be able to use HTTP to browse the Internet.

As port numbers are must to establish a connection between two applications/services, IANA(Internet Assigned Numbers Authority) kept fixed port numbres for well known services/applications.

2. Registered port numbers (1024-49151)
They are treated as semi-reserved port numbers and possible to registered for services with IANA.

3. Open(temporary/short lived) port numbers (49152-65535)
These port numbers can be used by client programs. For example, when Bob's web browser connects to a web server, Bob's web browser automatically assign a port number from this range to itself.

Note : If Bob's web browser(in separate tabs) connect to Yahoo and Microsoft web server, for each tab/connection Bob's web browser will assign a open port numbers.

There is another Transport layer protocol called UDP. Let's look at few thing about UDP,

## UDP
* UDP is a connection less application.
* It does not do error checking and will not retransmit missing packets. Means, does not provide a reliable connection.
* UDP is quicker than TCP. so, UDP is used for voice services as it needs real time packet delivery.
* Port numbers for UDP are different than port numbers for TCP.


###IMPORTANT QUESTION: If an attacker wants to access Bob's web browser application, what information attacker will need? Try to think.

Let's move to the next section.

### Your task
For examples, Bob opens 25 tabs in his web browser, how many TCP connections will be required? For all tabs, How many total handshakes will takes place?
