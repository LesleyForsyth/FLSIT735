## Welcome to SIT735 Communications Network Security

In this unit, we'll explore how to implement protocols to secure your communications network from attacks.  

Computer networks has grown from a few hundreds nodes in the 70â€™s to billions of devices connected
to the internet nowadays. Such a massive interconnection is leading organisations and individuals to an
increasing dependency of computer systems. Data that was before in a drawer is nowadays in a connected
computer, making information rapidly and easily accessible. Computer networks, however, have proven
vulnerable to cyberattacks, whose scale and impact tend to increase with the size of the network.

The unit is made up of five courses, each of which take two weeks to complete.
