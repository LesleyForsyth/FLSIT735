# A Brief introduction to communications network security

Computers started being connected to each other in the late 60s. As most technological breakthrough during the Information age, the focus during the development was on functionality, with security being mostly neglected. The problem is that computer networks started to grow, from small local area network at universities and military centers, to the internet, which by 2018 is connecting more than 20 billion devices.

Why would be a large network less secure than a small one? Think about an isolated computer with no connectivity. Such a computer would look like a huge drawer, capable of storing all sort of information, but with computational capabilities. Physical security and access control, i.e. ensuring that only authorised users have access to the computer, would normally suffice to make sure that the information remains isolated from non-authorised actors; as we do with a lockable drawer. 

Now assume that, in order to perform regular backups, we connect two computers that are located in different locations; hence creating the smallest computer network you can find. Each computer has access to the other one, meaning that breaking into one computer very likely will give access to the other one. Just scale up this example to billion of computing devices and the danger becomes obvious. 

## Network security

Network security is meant to prevent and monitor unauthorised access, misuse, or modification of network-accessible resources. Thus it concerns individuals, organisations, enterprises, and governments. 

Although this unit is about communications network security at the coorporate level mainly, 


* *Passwords*: Use large, unpredictable and secret passwords. Just in case, change all your passwords frequently.
* *Multi-factor authentication*: Passwords have been the de-facto authentication mechanism for users, but this is changing. It is nowadays common to see applications relying in other information sources that you own, such as your smartphone or a an electronic token. Enable multi-factor authentication whenever possible, 
* *Anti-virus and anti-malware*: Make sure you have those, as they will detect well-known patterns of malicious code. 
* *Help your anti-virus*: Do not open attachments or links unless you really really really trust the source. 
* *Software vulnerability*: Software vulnerabilities are found everyday. Vendors will try to patch those vulnerabilities as soon as possible, leading to an updated version of the software.
* *Firewall*: A firewall controls incoming and outgoing connections based on standard security rules. Do not turn off your firewall. 
* *Web security*: Make sure your browser is up-to-date. HTTP is insecure, better use HTTPS. 
* *Wireless Access Points*: The number of insecure wireless access points deployed in a city is overwhelmingly large, and people keep connecting to them because checking in a social network while drinking a coffee worths the risk. Do not connect to insecure wireless spots. 
* *Physical security*: At the very least, lock your computer every time you leave it unattended. 
* *Social engineering*: be aware of social engineering techniques used by hackers to  convince you into performing actions or divulging confidential information.
surface you can use a VMWare box that has no rights on your network.
* *Data backup and disk encryption*: Prepare for the worst. If someone get access to your computer you better secure your information via encryption. Do regular backups of your important data. 

In a larger organization, cybersecurity managers often play one of two roles: 

A technical security manager is typically in charge of the systems and the team that manages those systemsâ€”these are your typical sets of controls like firewalls, international business systems, data leakage protection systems, patching, encryption, vulnerability scanning, pen testing, and much more.
A program security manager is highly engaged in the world of risk management and mitigation. Typically, this individual is involved in evaluating vendor risk, examining vendor contracts or terms of service, helping different teams around the organization understand third-party risk and data privacy issues, and more.


Roles that you can contribute to with your skills in Cyber security:

* System administration in client systems and servers
* Network administration and network security operations
* Security assessment, security auditing and information assurance
* Threat analysis, intrusion and data analysis, intelligence and counter intelligence
* Forensics investigation
* Fundamentals of networks;
* Systems administration;
* How to protect computer networks and other systems by mitigating vulnerabilities and monitoring intrusions;
* How to perform digital forensic analysis of cybercrime by gathering information on the nature and extent of the attack for presentation in a court of law, as well as assessing the extent of the damage to an organization;
* Techniques of risk analysis;
* Risk assessment and vulnerability assessment.

Secure communication in networking systems rely on different actors and components. 

* *Protocols* are small programs or algorithms
