# A brief introduction to communications network security

Computers started being connected to each other in the late 60s. As most technological breakthrough during the Information age, the focus during the development was on functionality, with security being mostly neglected. The problem is that computer networks started to grow, from small local area network at universities and military centers, to the internet, which by 2018 is connecting more than 20 billion devices.

Why would a large network be less secure than a small one? Think about an isolated computer with no connectivity. Such a computer would look like a huge drawer, capable of storing all sort of information, with an additional feature: computational capacity. Physical security and access control, i.e. ensuring that only authorised users have access to the computer, would normally suffice to make sure that the information remains isolated from non-authorised actors; as we do with a lockable drawer. 

Now assume that, in order to perform regular backups, we connect two computers that are located in different locations; hence creating a fairly small computer network. Each computer has access to the other one, meaning that breaking into one computer very likely will give access to the other one. Just scale up this example to billion of computing devices and the danger becomes obvious. 

## What is Network security?

Network security is meant to prevent and monitor unauthorised access, misuse, or modification of network-accessible resources. That is to say, network security is about ensuring that the information going through the network serves the purpose that it was designed for, even in the presence of attackers. Thus it concerns individuals, organisations, enterprises, and governments alike. 

There are a variety of tasks and roles that a network security expert may perform in an organisation. For example, a network security expert can focus on:

* fundamentals of network security, such as data availability, confidentiality and integrity.
* the use and maintenance of anomaly-detection technologies
* the setup of local area networks with security mechanisms, such as firewalls, honeypots, DMEs, etc.
* system administration in client systems and servers
* vulnerability scanning, patching and software update
* pen testing
* risk management, mitigation and prioritisation
* decision making in the wake of security incidents
* forensics investigation
* process optimization and creation of agile controls

A single course cannot cover all those aspects in a meaningful way, and we are no exemption. We actually focus on the fundamentals of network security, namely availability, confidentiality and integrity, and how to achieve those goals by means of cryptographic protocols. 

We encourage the students to keep the list above handy and make sure that all items are covered in their formation in Cyber security. 



## Individual security in a hyperconnected world 

It may sound trivial but, before protecting a network from hackers, we should be aware first of how to protect ourselves. There are many resources on the internet with advices and guidelines on how you can make it harder for hackers to break into your computer, smartphone, router, smart meter, etc. A short and nice reading that I personally recommend is the "Top cyber security tips for individuals" offered by the Australian Government at https://www.ato.gov.au/General/Online-services/Identity-security/Protecting-your-information/Top-cyber-security-tips-for-individuals/. A summary is provided next. 

* *Passwords*: Use large, unpredictable and secret passwords. Do not share passwords between different applications or services. Change all your passwords frequently.
* *Multi-factor authentication*: Passwords have been the de-facto authentication mechanism for users, but this is changing. It is nowadays common to see applications relying in other information sources that you own, such as your smartphone or a an electronic token. Enable multi-factor authentication whenever possible. 
* *Anti-virus and anti-malware*: Make sure you have those, as they will detect well-known patterns of malicious code. 
* *Help your anti-virus*: Do not open attachments or links unless you really really really trust the source. 
* *Software vulnerability*: Software vulnerabilities are found everyday. Vendors will try to patch those vulnerabilities as soon as possible, leading to an updated version of the software, which you should install as soon as possible. 
* *Firewall*: A firewall controls incoming and outgoing connections based on standard security rules. Do not turn off your firewall. 
* *Web security*: Make sure your browser is up-to-date. HTTP is insecure, better use HTTPS. 
* *Wireless Access Points*: The number of insecure wireless access points deployed in a city is overwhelmingly large, and people keep connecting to them because checking in a social network while drinking a coffee worths the risk. Do not connect to insecure wireless spots. 
* *Physical security*: At the very least, lock your computer every time you leave it unattended. 
* *Social engineering*: be aware of social engineering techniques used by hackers to  convince you into performing actions or divulging confidential information.
* *Data backup and disk encryption*: Prepare for the worst. If someone get access to your computer you better secure your information via encryption. Do regular backups of your important data. 

## Your task

Discuss with your colleagues which of the above security measures you consider mandatory and which ones not.
