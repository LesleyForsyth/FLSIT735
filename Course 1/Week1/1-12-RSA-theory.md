# Wrap Up


I hope you got exited about the possibility of sending messages in an easy and secure way. That's of course not the end of this course, but rather just the beginning. At the moment we have been focusing on confidentiality, but there are other important security goals in communication systems that we will explore as the course advance, such integrity, availability, and non-repudation. 

Within the next few weeks we are going to zoom out from the field of cryptography to the field communication protocols. Communication protocols in a computer network act like traffic rules in a road network. They allow different components of the network to interact and communicate in an efficient and consistent way. When the communication protocol is also intended for secure communication, then we will normally call it a *security protocol*.

The next week is an exiting one, as you are going to learn the basics of networking; the roads and traffic rules that govern today's internet. We will put particular emphasis on what makes a network vulnerable, and what can interfere in the normal behaviour of a communication protocol. In other words, in the next week you will learn about the battle field where the Cyber war is being fought, and who or what can potentially be the enemy. 

## Your task 

RSA was published in the 1977 by Ron Rivest, Adi Shamir, and Leonard Adleman. It is considered one of the most elegant combination of Number theory (a field within Pure Mathematics) and Computational complexity (a field within Computer Science). I encourage you to increase your theoretical knowledge on RSA by reading Chapter 9.3 of the book "A classical introduction to cryptography" by Serge Vaudenay.
