# Let's get started

## Welcome to SIT735 Communications Network Security

Computer networks has grown from a few hundreds nodes in the 70â€™s to billions of devices connected
to the internet nowadays. Such a massive interconnection is leading organisations and individuals to an
increasing dependency of computer systems. Data that was before in a drawer is nowadays in a connected
computer, making information rapidly and easily accessible. Computer networks, however, have proven
vulnerable to cyberattacks, whose scale and impact tend to increase with the size of the network.

## Unit overview

In this unit, we'll explore how to implement protocols to secure your communications network from attacks. Over the course of the unit, you will:

* Describe approaches to computer security including access control, identity verification and authentication in order to minimise cyber attacks on a system.
* Understand different types of security and privacy goals and their applications. 
* Apply principles of public key cryptography to achieve secure communication networks by using digital certificates and digital signatures in compliance with industry standards
* Justify the use of cryptographic schemes on networked infrastructures to prevent the misuse of technology.

The unit is made up of five courses, each of which take two weeks to complete. 

## Overview of Course 1

Over the next two weeks, we're going to introduce you to the challenge of sending a confidential message over a public and insecure. We'll develop the ability to encrypt and decrypt digital information be using popular open-source tools, such as OpenSSL. 

During the second week we will have the opportunity to learn about the battle field where the Cyber war takes place: *the network*. In particular, we will focus on the attacker's ability to intercept, block, inject, and modify messages traveling throughout the network. 

By the end of this first course you should be able to:

* Understand the role of confidentiality in digital communication
* Be able to understand and use different types cryptographic algorithms 
* Understand the importance of using sufficiently large and random keys
* Make use of the tool OpenSSL to generate keys and encrypt and decrypt messages
* **Once Vikrant fininshes with the second week we will be able to add the learning outcomes to this list**


## Meet the team

Your Lead Educator is Dr Rolando Trujillo Rasua from Deakin's School of Information Technology.

Rolando is a computer scientist with a particular interest on formal aspects of computer security and privacy protection. He is currently a Lecturer in Cyber Security at Deakin University. 

You will also be support by Mr Vikrant Patel, who is a specialist in communications network security.
