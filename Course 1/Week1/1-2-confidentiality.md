# Confidentiality

Let us start this course with a definition of network security. Network security is the method in which an individual or organisation secures their network from possible attacks. Network security is actually a fundamental part of Information security, devoted to the protection of data and information systems against unauthorised or unintended access that can result in the loss, damage, modification and degrade of the information. 

As a security expert, you will hear often the initials CIA, hopefully in reference to Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability. The history of humanity is full of clever tricks to enforce those properties in communication exchanges, specially during war. In a nutshell, confidentiality ensures that information is unaccessible to unauthorised parties, integrity that data is an accurate representation of the original secure information, and availability that information is accessible for those authorised.

There is no need to memorise those three concepts by heart. They will emerge naturally as functional and security requirements of the security solutions we are going to study in this course. 

## Your task.

Your task is to use the chat window to send a confidential message to one of our colleagues. No other communication mean is allowed, except the FutureLearn chat window. Recall that confidentiality means that the message should remain secret for all, but the intended recipient. Be creative!

Something you will notice while this course advances, is that this very first challenge we are assigning to you is indeed fairly close to real-life challenges faced by security solutions.
