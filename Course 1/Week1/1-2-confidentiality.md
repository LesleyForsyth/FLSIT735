# Data breach 

It is May 2014. News were spread that a cyberattack exposed names, addresses, dates of birth and encrypted passwords of 145 million Ebay users. The attackers started the attack by first compromising the credentials of three corporate employees, then making their way to the user database. The company said that financial information, such as credit card numbers, was stored separately and was not compromised. 

More recently, in 2016, RxAmerica and Accendo Insurance Company informed that personal information of 175,000 members may have been unintentionally exposed. The breach was caused by a change of the mail format, allowing lines of text to become visible.
The letters included the member’s name, drug name and date of birth.

These are just two examples of a confidential information being leaked. For a  comprehensive list of data breach scandals refer to https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_data_breaches.

## Confidentiality

When we talk about confidentiality of information, we are talking about making sure that information is unaccessible to unauthorised parties. 

Information has value. By taking a quick look at the Facebook–Cambridge Analytica data scandal, it becomes clear that many company business models are data driven. On the other hand, the existence of sensitive information such as bank account statements, personal information, credit card numbers, trade secrets, and government documents, make confidentiality an obvious security goal. 

The good news is that there exists a plethora of cryptographic algorithms based on mathematical theory and computer science that, when used correctly, can protect information confidentiality. We will devote this week to the introduction of cryptography and how it can be used to send confidential information through an insecure network. 

## Your task.

Your task is to use the chat window to send a confidential message to one of our colleagues. No other communication mean is allowed, except the FutureLearn chat window. Recall that confidentiality means that the message should remain secret for all, but the intended recipient. Be creative!

Something you will notice while this course advances, is that this very first challenge we are assigning to you is indeed fairly close to real-life challenges faced by security solutions.
