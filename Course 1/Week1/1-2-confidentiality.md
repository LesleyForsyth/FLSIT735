# Confidentiality

Let us start this course with a definition of network security. Network security is the method in which an individual or organisation secures their network from possible attacks. Network security is actually a fundamental part of Information security, which is devoted to the protection of information and information systems against unauthorised access or any other factor that can result in the loss, damage, modification and degrade of the information. 

The most obvious goal in secure communication is confidentiality. A confidential message should remain secret for all, but the intended recipient.
