## Introduction

Hello, and welcome to Communications Network Security.

I'm your lead educator, Rolando Trujillo.

If you are in this course is because you aim at becoming a Cyber security expert. That is, you would like to protect data and information systems against unauthorised or unintended access. This course will put you one step further on that goal, as you will learn how data can be protected when in transit. 

The big question we will address is: 'how can we protect our communications in the digital era?'

In 2009, a hacker was sentenced to 20 years in jail after he managed to steal credit card details from 90 million people.  According to court documents, the attack had cost companies over $200 million.

In 2014, celebrities were involved in a targetted hack of Apple iCloud.  The attackers later published highly personal and sensitive photographs of their victims without their consent.

In 2016, over 400 million accounts were hacked from the AdultFriendFinder network, exposing people's intended infidelity to their partners.  

Communications networks, then, often hold very sensitive information and the consequences of an attack can be dire to the individuals and organisations that are targetted.

In this course, we'll explore the funadmentals behind making sure your network remains confidential, available and maintains its integrity in an effort to guard against such attacks.

By the end of the course, you will be able to:

* Describe approaches to computer security including access control, identity verification and authentication in order to minimise cyber attacks on a system.
* Understand different types of security and privacy goals and their applications. 
* Apply principles of public key cryptography to achieve secure communication networks by using digital certificates and digital signatures in compliance with industry standards, and
* Justify the use of cryptographic schemes on networked infrastructures to prevent the misuse of technology.

Good luck, and I'll see you in the course.

## Wrap up

Well done, you've made it through the first course.

We started the course by looking at the basics of cryptography.  Cryptography is fundamental to network security and from the basis of industrial network security standards.  Throughout the course, you've learnt to send and receive secret messages to one-another in FutuerLearn and applied this to the way it's done in modern communication networks.

We then got an overview of the structure of communications networks and the points at which it is vulnerable.  We looked at some of the ways that an attacker could exploit these vulnerabilities and cause harm to the people who rely on your network.  That is you, your organisation and the people who rely on it.

Next week, we'll look at some of the most common network security protocols employed to protect communications networks.  

See you there.
