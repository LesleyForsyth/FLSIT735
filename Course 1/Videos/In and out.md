## Introduction

Hello, and welcome to Communications Network Security.

I'm your lead educator, Rolando Trujillo.

In this course we ask the big question: 'how can we prevent out communications networks from attack?'

What can happen when a computer network is hacked?

In 2009, a hacker was sentenced to 20 years in jail after he managed to steal credit card details from 90 million people.  The communications network attack had cost companies over $200 million.

In 2014, celebrities were involved in a targetted hack of Apple iCloud.  The attackers later published highly personal and sensitive photographs of their victims without their consent.

In 2016, over 400 million accounts were hacked from the AdultFriendFinder network, exposing people's intended infidelity to their partners.  
Communications networks, then, often hold very sensitive information and the consequences of an attack can be dire to the individuals and organisations that are targetted.

In this course, you'll learn how to secure your communications networks against such attacks.  By the end of the course, you will be able to:

* Describe approaches to computer security including access control, identity verification and authentication in order to minimise cyber attacks on a system.
* Compare and contrast different types of cryptography including current cryptographic algorithms and their applications. 
* Apply principles of public key cryptography to achieve secure communication networks by using digital certificates and digital signatures in compliance with industry standards, and
* Justify the use of cryptographic schemes on networked infrastructures to prevent the misuse of technology.

Good luck, and I'll see you in the course.
